* **File Name Suggestion:** `feature_development_plan_workflow.md`
* **Version:** 1.1
* **Last Updated:** 2025-05-20
* **Author/Maintainer:** ManagementMode

## 1. Purpose & Goal

* **Primary Objective:** To systematically guide the development of a new software feature from initial conception through planning, development, testing, deployment, and post-release review, ensuring it meets user needs and business objectives.
* **Scope:**
    * **In Scope:** Covers the entire lifecycle of a single new feature, including ideation, requirements gathering, design, implementation, quality assurance, release, and initial post-launch monitoring.
    * **Out of Scope:** Overall product strategy (though this workflow consumes it as input), long-term maintenance beyond the initial post-release phase, portfolio-level prioritization across multiple features (though it provides input to such processes).
* **Intended Users/Modes:** ManagementMode (orchestrator), ProductManagerMode, LeadDeveloperMode, DeveloperMode(s), QAMode, ArchitectMode, TechnicalWriterMode.
* **Success Indicators (High-Level):**
    * Feature delivered meets defined requirements and user needs.
    * Feature is stable and performs adequately in production.
    * Positive user feedback or adoption.

## 2. Guiding Principles & Philosophy

* **User-Centricity:** All decisions are driven by the needs and value delivered to the end-user.
* **Iterative Progress (within phases if applicable):** While the overall workflow has distinct phases, activities within can be iterative, especially design and development.
* **Quality by Design:** Quality assurance is integrated throughout the lifecycle, not just a final testing phase.
* **Clear Communication & Collaboration:** Ensure all involved modes have a shared understanding and work collaboratively.
* **Defined Scope & Requirements:** Strive for clear and agreed-upon scope and requirements before extensive development.

* **Triggers (Inputs):**
    * [X] New feature idea/request (from Product Backlog, strategic initiative, user feedback).
    * [X] Market analysis or business case (if available).
* **Key Activities & Jobs (Checklist & Task Templates):**
    * [X] **Activity 1.1:** Define Feature Scope & Value Proposition
        * **Description:** Articulate the problem the feature solves, target users, core functionalities, and expected business/user value.
        * **Typical Mode(s) Responsible:** ProductManagerMode, ManagementMode.
        * **Task Checklist:**
            * [ ] Document problem statement.
            * [ ] Identify and profile target users.
            * [ ] List core high-level functionalities.
            * [ ] Define key success metrics (e.g., adoption rate, task completion time).
            * [ ] Identify known constraints or limitations.
        * **Expected Output:** Feature Scope Document (initial draft) or detailed PBI.
        * **Acceptance Criteria:** Clear articulation of feature's purpose, users, core functions, and value.
    * [X] **Activity 1.2:** Initial Feasibility Study
        * **Description:** Assess high-level technical feasibility, resource needs, and potential risks.
        * **Typical Mode(s) Responsible:** LeadDeveloperMode, ArchitectMode, ProductManagerMode.
        * **Task Checklist:**
            * [ ] High-level technical assessment (can we build this with current/planned tech?).
            * [ ] Rough estimate of resource types needed (dev, QA, etc.).
            * [ ] Identify major potential risks (technical, market, resource).
        * **Expected Output:** Feasibility Report/Summary.
        * **Acceptance Criteria:** Clear "go/no-go" recommendation or identified areas needing further investigation.
* **Tools & Resources:** `task-manager-server` (for creating tracking tasks for this phase), collaborative documents.
* **Deliverables & Outputs for this Phase (Checklist):**
    * [X] Deliverable 1.A: Initial Feature Scope Document / High-Level PBI
        * **Description:** Document outlining the feature's purpose, target users, core functions, value, and success metrics.
        * **Format:** Markdown file or detailed entry in `task-manager-server` notes.
    * [X] Deliverable 1.B: Feasibility Summary
        * **Description:** Brief report on technical feasibility, resource needs, and risks.
        * **Format:** Markdown snippet or `task-manager-server` note.
