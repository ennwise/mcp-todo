# Workflow: Plan Review and Consolidation

**Objective:** To facilitate a thorough review of a project plan, consolidate feedback, revise the plan accordingly, and obtain final stakeholder approval.

**Phases:**

1.  **Initiation & Preparation:**
    *   **Objective:** Define the scope of the review and identify reviewers.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Confirm the plan document to be reviewed.
        *   Identify and assign appropriate reviewer modes (e.g., ArchitectMode, LeadDeveloperMode).
        *   Create a main tracking task for the review process.
    *   **Typical Modes:** Management

2.  **Internal Review & Feedback Collection:**
    *   **Objective:** Gather detailed feedback on the plan from designated reviewers.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Delegate plan review to `ArchitectMode` (focus: architectural soundness, high-level design, risks).
        *   Delegate plan review to `LeadDeveloperMode` (focus: technical feasibility, resource estimates, timelines, implementation details).
        *   Each reviewer provides feedback, possibly as comments, annotations, or a separate document.
    *   **Typical Modes:** `ArchitectMode`, `LeadDeveloperMode`

3.  **Feedback Consolidation & Analysis:**
    *   **Objective:** Aggregate all feedback and identify key areas for revision.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Collect feedback from all reviewers.
        *   Analyze feedback for common themes, conflicts, and critical issues.
        *   Prioritize feedback based on impact and feasibility.
    *   **Typical Modes:** Management, `TechnicalWriterMode` (for organizing feedback)

4.  **Plan Revision:**
    *   **Objective:** Update the project plan based on consolidated feedback.
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Assign plan revision to an appropriate mode (e.g., `TechnicalWriterMode` for documentation changes, `DeveloperMode` or `LeadDeveloperMode` if technical aspects require significant rework).
        *   Incorporate agreed-upon changes into the plan document.
        *   Ensure version control for the revised plan (e.g., `_v2`).
    *   **Typical Modes:** `TechnicalWriterMode`, `DeveloperMode`, `LeadDeveloperMode`

5.  **Final Review & Stakeholder Approval:**
    *   **Objective:** Present the revised plan for final review and approval by stakeholders (User).
    *   **Activities:**
        *   Management presents the finalized plan to the User.
        *   User reviews the plan and provides approval or requests further minor adjustments.
        *   If further adjustments are minor, iterate on Phase 4 quickly. If major, re-evaluate.
    *   **Typical Modes:** Management

**Key Outputs:**

*   Consolidated feedback document/summary.
*   Revised and approved project plan document.
*   Tracking tasks updated with review outcomes and decisions.

**Considerations:**

*   Clearly define the focus for each reviewer to avoid redundant feedback.
*   Establish a timeline for each phase.
*   Use a consistent method for collecting and tracking feedback.
*   Ensure clear communication between all involved modes and the User.
