## 1. Purpose & Goal

* **Primary Objective:** To guide the design, development, documentation, deployment, and versioning of robust, secure, usable, and maintainable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that meet the needs of their intended consumers (internal or external).
* **Scope:**
    * **In Scope:** Entire lifecycle of a new API or a major new version of an existing API. Includes requirement gathering, design (contract-first), implementation, testing (functional, security, performance, contract), documentation, deployment, and initial monitoring.
    * **Out of Scope:** Minor patches or bug fixes to existing API versions (which might follow a streamlined version of this or the bug fix workflow), overall platform API governance strategy (though this workflow adheres to it), client-side integration development (focus is on the API provider side).
* **Intended Users/Modes:** ArchitectMode, LeadDeveloperMode, DeveloperMode(s), ProductManagerMode, QAMode, SecurityExpertMode, TechnicalWriterMode, ManagementMode.
* **Success Indicators (High-Level):**
    * API meets defined functional and non-functional requirements.
    * High adoption rate by intended consumers.
    * Positive developer experience (DX) for API consumers.
    * API is secure, reliable, and performs well.

## 2. Guiding Principles & Philosophy

* **Contract-First Design:** Define the API contract (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) before writing implementation code. This contract serves as the source of truth.
* **Consumer-Centricity:** Design APIs with the needs and perspectives of their consumers in mind.
* **Consistency & Predictability:** Adhere to established API design guidelines and patterns for a consistent developer experience.
* **Security by Design:** Integrate security considerations throughout the API lifecycle.

## 8. Notes & Special Considerations

* This workflow emphasizes a "design-first" or "contract-first" approach to API development.
* Versioning is critical and must be planned from the outset to manage changes without breaking existing consumers.
* Security is not just a phase but should be considered at every step (authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting, data protection).
* API Gateways are often used for managing aspects like security, rate limiting, traffic management, and analytics.
* Consider providing a sandbox environment for API consumers to test integrations.
