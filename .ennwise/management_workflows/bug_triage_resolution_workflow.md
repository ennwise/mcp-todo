## 1. Purpose & Goal

* **Primary Objective:** To establish a consistent and efficient process for reporting, verifying, prioritizing, assigning, resolving, and verifying software bugs, thereby minimizing their impact on users and improving overall product quality.
* **Scope:**
    * **In Scope:** Covers the entire lifecycle of a bug, from initial report to final closure after verification of the fix. Includes bugs found internally (QA, dev) and externally (users, support).
    * **Out of Scope:** Feature requests disguised as bugs (these should be rerouted to product backlog), architectural refactoring to prevent future bugs (though root cause analysis might inform such needs).
* **Intended Users/Modes:** QAMode, DeveloperMode(s), LeadDeveloperMode, ProductManagerMode, UserSupportMode, ManagementMode.
* **Success Indicators (High-Level):**
    * Reduced time to resolve critical bugs.
    * Improved user satisfaction related to bug handling.
    * Decreased number of recurring bugs.

## 2. Guiding Principles & Philosophy

* **User Impact First:** Prioritize bugs based on their impact on users and business operations.
* **Reproducibility is Key:** Strive to get clear, reproducible steps for all reported bugs.
* **Clear Communication:** Ensure all involved modes have up-to-date information on bug status and resolution.
* **Quality Fixes:** Aim for fixes that address the root cause and do not introduce regressions.
* **Continuous Learning:** Use bug data and trends to identify areas for improvement in development and testing processes.

## 3. Key Roles Involved (Typical Modes & Responsibilities)

* **Primary Coordinator(s):**
    * **Mode/Role:** LeadDeveloperMode or QAModeLead (often responsible for triage meetings and assignment).
    * **Key Responsibilities:** Overseeing the triage process, ensuring bugs are prioritized and assigned correctly, tracking overall bug metrics.
* **Key Contributor(s):**
    * **Mode/Role:** UserSupportMode / EndUserMode (Bug Reporter)
    * **Key Responsibilities:** Reporting bugs with clear details.
    * **Mode/Role:** QAMode
    * **Key Responsibilities:** Verifying and reproducing reported bugs, detailed logging, assigning initial severity/priority, test case creation for bug fix verification, regression testing.
    * **Mode/Role:** DeveloperMode(s)
    * **Key Responsibilities:** Investigating assigned bugs, implementing fixes, unit testing fixes.
    * **Mode/Role:** ProductManagerMode

* Clear definitions of Severity and Priority levels are essential and must be understood by all involved modes.
* Effective communication between QAMode, DeveloperMode, and ProductManagerMode is crucial.
* Automation in testing (for regression) can significantly improve the efficiency of this workflow.
* Integrating the bug tracker with version control and CI/CD systems can streamline information flow.
