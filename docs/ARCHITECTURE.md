# Architecture

## Module Structure

The RustQuote service is organized into the following modules:

*   **`api_handler`**: Responsible for handling incoming API requests, parsing them, and formulating appropriate HTTP responses. It will interact with other modules like `quote_generator` to fetch data and `models` for data structures.
*   **`quote_generator`**: Contains the core logic for managing and retrieving quotes. This includes loading quotes from a source (e.g., a file), selecting a random quote, or fetching a specific quote.
*   **`config_manager`**: Manages application configuration. This could involve loading settings from environment variables or configuration files.
*   **`models`**: Defines the primary data structures used throughout the application, such as the `Quote` struct. These models will likely use `serde` for serialization and deserialization.
*   **`utils`**: A collection of common utility functions that can be used by various parts of the application.
