## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Project Name
RustQuote Service

### 1.2. Project Goals & Objectives
*   Develop a web service that provides random quotes to users/clients.
*   Implement the service using the Rust programming language to leverage its performance and safety features.
*   Utilize Docker for containerization, enabling consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
*   Employ DevOps principles and practices throughout the project lifecycle for efficient development, automated testing, and streamlined operations.

---

## 2. Project Scope

### 2.1. High-Level Technical Scope
*   **In Scope:**
    *   **Core Functionality:**
        *   API Endpoint: `GET /quote` (RESTful).
        *   Response Format: JSON `{"quote": "...", "author": "..."}`.
    *   **Source of Quotes:** Embedded list or simple flat data file (JSON, CSV) packaged with the service. *(Note: For MVP, a simple file is sufficient. Future iterations should consider the scalability of this data source if quote volume or update frequency increases significantly, potentially moving to a database or more robust file management solution.)*
    *   **Basic Operational Aspects:** Basic application logging (stdout/stderr), `GET /health` endpoint.

### 2.2. Out of Scope (MVP)
User authentication/management, user quote submission, UI, advanced analytics, database persistence (beyond simple file), API versioning, rate limiting, quote categorization/search, internationalization.

### 2.3. Key Technologies
Rust, Docker, lightweight Rust web framework (e.g., Actix-web, Axum), `serde` for JSON.

### 2.4. High-Level Architectural Considerations
Stateless RESTful API, single lightweight microservice/monolith, P95 response <200ms, horizontal scalability via Docker instances, reliability, maintainability, simplicity. *Future scalability of the quote data source (currently planned as a simple flat file) will be a consideration for post-MVP development.*

## 7. Risk Management

### 7.1. Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description                                                                 | Category   | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                | Contingency Plan                                                                                                |
| :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R001    | Unforeseen technical complexities in Rust language or chosen libraries (including the web framework) lead to development delays. | Technical  | H      | M          | Allocate time for research spikes; ensure team has access to Rust expertise/training; conduct early PoCs for complex features. | Re-prioritize features; allocate additional developer resources if available; adjust project timeline.          |
| R002    | Key developer(s) with specialized Rust knowledge become unavailable (e.g., illness, departure). | Resource   | H      | L          | Promote knowledge sharing and code documentation; cross-train team members on critical modules; identify backup personnel. | Engage contract Rust developers; adjust scope to reduce dependency on specialized knowledge; revise timeline. |
| R003    | Integration with external data providers (e.g., for pricing, market data) proves more difficult or unreliable than anticipated. | Technical/External | M      | M          | Thoroughly vet API documentation and conduct early integration tests; develop robust error handling and retry mechanisms. | Identify alternative data providers; build mock services for development/testing; de-scope features reliant on problematic APIs. |
| R004    | Scope creep due to evolving stakeholder requirements or unclear initial specifications. | Scope      | M      | H          | Implement a formal change request process; clearly define and document initial scope; regular backlog grooming with Product Owner. | Prioritize new requests against existing backlog; negotiate trade-offs (e.g., defer less critical features); allocate additional sprints if approved. |
| R005    | Performance issues arise under expected user load, impacting service responsiveness. | Technical  | H      | M          | Conduct regular performance testing throughout development; optimize critical code paths; design for scalability from the outset. | Scale infrastructure (e.g., add more server resources); implement caching strategies; conduct emergency performance optimization. |
| R006    | Security vulnerabilities discovered in the Rust code, dependencies, or deployment environment. | Technical  | H      | M          | Conduct regular security code reviews; use static analysis security testing (SAST) tools; keep dependencies updated; implement security best practices for deployment. | Isolate affected systems; apply patches immediately; conduct a post-mortem to prevent recurrence; notify stakeholders as per incident response plan. |
| R007    | Delays in setting up or configuring the required development, testing, or production environments (including CI/CD pipeline setup and configuration). | Technical/Schedule | M      | L          | Automate environment provisioning (Infrastructure as Code); prepare environment checklists and test them early; assign dedicated personnel for environment setup. | Allocate additional resources to expedite setup; simplify environment requirements if possible; adjust deployment schedule. |
| R008    | Quote data file parsing complexity for the 'simple flat data file' is higher than expected. | Technical  | L      | L          | Assume simple, well-defined format (e.g., clean JSON/CSV). If format is unexpectedly complex or malformed, parsing logic may take longer. | Allocate small buffer from project contingency; simplify format if possible during initial setup; use robust parsing libraries. |
| R009    | Test harness development complexity for unit, integration, and API tests in Rust is underestimated. | Technical  | M      | M          | Setting up comprehensive and effective test suites, along with code coverage tracking, might be more involved than estimated. | Prioritize critical path tests for MVP; simplify test cases initially; allocate buffer from project contingency; leverage existing testing patterns/examples. |
| R010    | Dockerfile optimization effort for a production-ready image is higher than anticipated for MVP. | Technical  | L      | M          | Creating a highly optimized, multi-stage, small, and secure Dockerfile may take more time than a basic functional one. | For MVP, prioritize a functional Dockerfile that meets basic requirements; defer advanced optimization if time-constrained, document for future work. |
| R011    | API error handling nuances across various edge cases prove more complex to implement consistently. | Technical  | M      | M          | Implementing robust, consistent, and user-friendly API error handling for all potential scenarios can be more intricate than initially planned. | Define clear error categories and standard responses early; implement incrementally; leverage web framework's default error handling where sensible; thorough testing of error paths. |
