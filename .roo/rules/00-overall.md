Detail what you are currently working on, and remaining items  Summarize work done, detail what you are currently doing, and detail what is left to do, and return immediately to the calling task letting them know you have partially completed the task and want to reissue it as a new task.

The  project directory is at /workspaces/mcp-todo/  with ./Cargo.toml and ./Dockerfile etc.

Doing cargo run will freeze the terminal. Recommend to use docker compose to start/stop/test during development. Port in use means it's probably been ran independently on its own somewhere.

Use ./scripts/view_logs.sh to check the docker compose instance logs if you need them after doing a docker compose up / down etc. This ensures the right command that doesn't have issues is used.
