//! # Quote Generation
//!
//! This module is intended to house logic for generating new quotes,
//! potentially using algorithms or external AI services.
//!
//! Currently, it contains placeholder functionality.

/// Placeholder function for demonstrating quote generation.
///
/// This function will be replaced with actual quote generation logic
/// in a future development iteration.
